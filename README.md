# data_cleaning
Code for cleaning Washtenaw County parcel data and adding with census tract GEOIDs.  In order to run the code, you'll need the Wash_nocoords.csv data file as well as the Census tract data for Michigan (which you can acquire here: https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_tracts.html)

You'll need Jupyter to run the code, as well as the `geopandas` and `shapely` python modules.
