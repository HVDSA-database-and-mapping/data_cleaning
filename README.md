# data_cleaning
Code for cleaning Washtenaw County parcel data and adding with census tract GEOIDs.  In order to run the code, you'll need the Wash_nocoords.csv data file as well as the Census tract shapefiles for Michigan (which you can acquire here: https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/cbf/cbf_tracts.html).  You can also get these files, and the output .csv file, from the `Washtenaw Parcel Data with Census Tract GEOID` folder on the Gdrive.

You'll need Jupyter to run the code, as well as the `geopandas` and `shapely` python modules.  If you just want to look at the notebook and process, then you can view the .html version of the notebook in your browser.
